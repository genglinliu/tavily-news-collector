Horton\n The range of suggested timings both globally and regionally may reflect the method of analysis or the influence of the long-term rate of change and the amplitude of pre-industrial variability among locations or may arise from regional variability in sea-level change, due to processes such as the gravitational, rotational, and deformational fingerprints of mass loss from ice sheet and glacier melt or changes in ocean and atmosphere circulation3,18. Here, we remove a constraint on the model that was applied in Kopp et al.9, Kemp et al.40, and Walker et al.19 that mean global sea level over \u00e2\u02c6\u2019100 to 100 CE is equal to mean global sea level over 1600\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1800 CE because, with the current, expanded database, the results of the analysis with and without the constraint are nearly the same; a constant ~\u00c2\u00b10.1\u00e2\u20ac\u2030mm/yr ambiguity in the long-term trend is no longer apparent.\n"

The trends were calculated for different time periods (see Fig.\u00a02a), but 43-year AA ratios (hereafter referred to AA43) were chosen to be of the primary interest, because (i) 43 years covers the majority of the recent warming period when the warming has been approximately linear (Fig.\u00a01a), (ii) the reanalysis products, such as ERA5, are known to be more reliable during this period because satellite remote sensing data on atmospheric variables and sea ice concentration have become largely available since 197973, and (iii) there is disagreement between ERA5 and the three in-situ datasets in the Arctic prior to 1979 (see Fig.\u00a01a). Defining the Arctic amplification\nWe follow the recommendation of Smith et al.72, and define Arctic amplification (AA) as the ratio of Arctic warming to the global-mean warming:\nwhere dT/dtA and dT/dtG are the slopes of linear trends of near-surface temperature, calculated using a least-squares fitting for the annual and monthly mean values for the Arctic and global domain."

While the prevailing scientific consensus and evidence attributes modern climate change to human activity, some analysts argue that Earth\u2019s climate has always undergone natural fluctuations and that recent changes are within the bounds of historical variability. Climate change skeptics often suggest that current warming trends may partly result from natural solar fluctuations rather than human activities, however, the same has been debunked by NASA. The unprecedented rise in global temperatures, coupled with the highest carbon dioxide levels in 2 million years, highlights a significant departure from natural climate cycles, emphasizing the dominant role of human influence and reinforcing the importance of implementing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies."

In fact, the 20th century was the warmest of the past 10 centuries, and the decade 2011\u201320 was the warmest decade since the beginning of modern instrumental record keeping. Carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases, and they have a profound effect on the energy budget of the Earth system despite making up only a fraction of all atmospheric gases. Greenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are gas molecules that have the property of absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth\u2019s surface and reradiating it back to Earth\u2019s surface, thus contributing to the phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.

Together, our study (1) adds to the documented records of increased coral thermal tolerance after bleaching events, (2) identifies the most-likely rate of thermal tolerance increase for Palau to date, and (3) shows that although shifts in thermal tolerance can help coral reefs escape the impacts of extreme ocean heat events, this will only be possible if ambitious global commitments on carbon emissions reductions are realised.\n"

To calculate consumption-based emissions we need to track which goods are traded across the world, and whenever a good was imported we need to include all CO2 emissions that were emitted in the production of that good, and vice versa to subtract all CO2 emissions that were emitted in the production of goods that were exported.\n The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total CO2 emissions9 are shown on the basis of two axes: the height of the bar (y-axis) is the average per capita CO2 emissions and the length of the box (x This is because a large fraction of CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years once emitted.4\nThis inequality is one of the main reasons which makes international agreement on who should take action so challenging.\nConsumption-based (trade-adjusted) emissions\nCO2 emissions are typically measured on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproduction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122."

Florida State University - FCC\nSea Level Rise - Florida Climate Center\nFlorida Climate Center\nSea Level Rise\nSea Level Rise and Coastal Risk\nDownload report in PDF format\nor read the report below.\n Satellite altimetry data indicate that the average rate of sea level rise in the Southeast U.S. region has been about 3.0 mm (0.12 inches) per year since the early 1990s, which is roughly equal to the global rate of sea level rise. Sea levels are rising globally as a result of ocean warming and land-based ice melt; however, local coastal vulnerability and risk are driven by the total water level experienced at a given location based on the interaction of rising sea levels with astronomical tides, storm surges, and ocean waves, as well as with coastal infrastructure and population. Projections in the relative sea level rise along the contiguous U.S. coastline range from 1.96 \u2013 7.22 ft (0.6\u20132.2 m) by the year 2100 and 2.62 \u2013 12.8 ft (0.8\u20133.9 m) by the year 2150, relative to sea levels in 2000."

Since we are interested in the climatological behaviour of the disintegration of one or more of the cryosphere elements, we artificially change the setup of CLIMBER-2 depending on which element we remove: In case of WAIS and GIS, the topography of the ice sheet itself is removed together with the ice sheet as the height of the ice sheet is several thousand metres thick and thus might play an important role on the feedbacks.

Jet streams are strongest in the winter because temperature contrasts are greater. Other Jet Streams How a Jet Stream Works The two key players in jet stream formation are temperature gradients and the Earth\u2019s rotation. Combining the temperature-driven pressure differences with the Coriolis effect results in the formation of jet streams. This westerly flow of air, concentrated in a narrow band, is a jet stream.

(Note each model response is calculated separately using its own global-mean change in surface air temperature.) Thus, the fast upper-level meridional jet stream wind distribution involves a multiplicative (percent) increase under climate change and not an additive increase (shift of the entire distribution) toward increased waviness. It is also consistent with the fast-get-faster response of upper-level waviness emerging given the historical meridional wind distribution and a multiplicative increase of 2%/K (given only the change in global-mean surface air temperature with no change in temperature gradient, red line Fig. 3a)."

Changes in sea surface temperature can shift storm tracks, potentially contributing to droughts in some areas.5 Increases in sea surface temperature\u00a0are also expected to lengthen the growth season for certain bacteria that can contaminate seafood and cause foodborne illnesses, thereby increasing the risk of health effects.6\nAbout the Indicator\nThis indicator tracks average global sea surface temperature from 1880 through 2020. The shaded band shows the range of uncertainty in the data, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used.\n Increases in sea surface temperature have led to an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor over the oceans.4\u00a0This water vapor feeds weather systems that produce precipitation, increasing the risk of heavy rain and snow (see the Heavy Precipitation and Tropical Cyclone Activity indicators). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has carefully reconstructed and filtered the data in Figure 1 to correct for biases in the different collection techniques and to minimize the effects of sampling changes over various locations and times."

As ocean acidification continues to worsen, it threatens the survival of coral reefs and the incredible biodiversity they support, emphasizing the urgent need for action to reduce carbon emissions and protect these vital ecosystems. As the ocean absorbs excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the water becomes more acidic, making it harder for some plankton to build their protective shells. Reducing carbon emissions is critical to slowing the rate of ocean acidification and protecting marine ecosystems. These habitats naturally absorb and store significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and ocean, helping to regulate pH levels and mitigate the effects of acidification."

But, it estimated that regrowth of old forests offset some of these losses, leading to a net loss of 102 million hectares.10\nThe latest UN Forest Resources Assessment estimates that the net loss in forests has declined in the last three decades, from 78 million hectares in the 1990s to 47 million hectares in the 2010s.\n Estimates vary, but on average only 10-20% of carbon is lost during logging, and 10-30% from fires.28 In a study of logging practices in the Amazon and Congo, forests retained 76% of their carbon stocks shortly after logging.29 Logged forests recover their carbon over time, as long as the land is not converted to other uses (which is what happens in the case of deforestation).\n In the chart we see the comparison between the change in domestic forest area, and deforestation driven by imported goods.33 On the vertical axis we have the domestic change in forest area: this is shown only for countries where the forest area is increasing."

When asked what they regard as \"the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years,\" on a scale of 1 to 10, from Trivial to Catastrophic: 13% of respondents replied 1 to 3 (trivial/mild), 44% replied 4 to 7 (moderate), 41% replied 8 to 10 (severe/catastrophic), and 2% didn't know.[108]\nIn 2012, James L. Powell, a former member of the National Science Board, analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24\n(<0.2%) rejected anthropogenic global warming.[109][110][111][112] This was a follow-up to an analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed articles published between November 2012 and December 2013, which revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.[113][114][115]\nDennis Bray and Hans von Storch had conducted their fourth survey in 2013, publishing its results the following year.\n No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.[10] A few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions,[11] and some have tried to persuade the public that climate change is not happening, or if the climate is changing it is not because of human influence,[12][13] attempting to sow doubt in the scientific consensus (see climate change denial).[14]\nExistence of a scientific consensus\nA question that frequently arose in popular discussion was whether there is a scientific consensus on climate change.[19]\nSeveral scientific organizations have explicitly used the term \"consensus\" in their statements:\nConsensus points\nThe current scientific consensus is that:\nChanges in global temperature are usually expressed in terms of temperature anomalies: \"In climate change studies, temperature anomalies are more important than absolute temperature. \", it went from 4.17 to 3.62.[90] Notably, the percentage of respondents \"strongly disagreeing\" stayed the same, at 10%, and a similar percentage stayed neutral (14% in 1996 and 13% in 2003): yet, the overall split went from 41% agreement and 45% disagreement in 1996 to 56% agreement and 30% disagreement in 2003, as there was both a substantial increase in agreement and a decline percentage of those disagreeing less strongly.[91] Similarly, there was a 72% to 20% split in favour of describing the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that \"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions.\". There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.[84]\nSurveys of scientists' views on climate change\nSurveys of scientists' views on climate change \u2013 with a focus on human-caused or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) \u2013 have been undertaken since the 1970s.[30][31] A 2016 paper (which was co-authored by Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton and John Cook, and which was based on a half a dozen independent studies by the authors) concluded that \"the finding of 97% consensus [that humans are causing recent global warming] in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies."

When asked what they regard as \"the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years,\" on a scale of 1 to 10, from Trivial to Catastrophic: 13% of respondents replied 1 to 3 (trivial/mild), 44% replied 4 to 7 (moderate), 41% replied 8 to 10 (severe/catastrophic), and 2% didn't know.[108]\nIn 2012, James L. Powell, a former member of the National Science Board, analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24\n(<0.2%) rejected anthropogenic global warming.[109][110][111][112] This was a follow-up to an analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed articles published between November 2012 and December 2013, which revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.[113][114][115]\nDennis Bray and Hans von Storch had conducted their fourth survey in 2013, publishing its results the following year.\n No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.[10] A few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions,[11] and some have tried to persuade the public that climate change is not happening, or if the climate is changing it is not because of human influence,[12][13] attempting to sow doubt in the scientific consensus (see climate change denial).[14]\nExistence of a scientific consensus\nA question that frequently arose in popular discussion was whether there is a scientific consensus on climate change.[19]\nSeveral scientific organizations have explicitly used the term \"consensus\" in their statements:\nConsensus points\nThe current scientific consensus is that:\nChanges in global temperature are usually expressed in terms of temperature anomalies: \"In climate change studies, temperature anomalies are more important than absolute temperature. \", it went from 4.17 to 3.62.[90] Notably, the percentage of respondents \"strongly disagreeing\" stayed the same, at 10%, and a similar percentage stayed neutral (14% in 1996 and 13% in 2003): yet, the overall split went from 41% agreement and 45% disagreement in 1996 to 56% agreement and 30% disagreement in 2003, as there was both a substantial increase in agreement and a decline percentage of those disagreeing less strongly.[91] Similarly, there was a 72% to 20% split in favour of describing the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that \"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions.\". There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.[84]\nSurveys of scientists' views on climate change\nSurveys of scientists' views on climate change \u2013 with a focus on human-caused or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) \u2013 have been undertaken since the 1970s.[30][31] A 2016 paper (which was co-authored by Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton and John Cook, and which was based on a half a dozen independent studies by the authors) concluded that \"the finding of 97% consensus [that humans are causing recent global warming] in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies."

Observational data from 2017 shown in the figures is based on the average of the first 10 months of the year and is likely to be quite similar to the ultimate annual value.\n The black dots show observed temperatures from the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, while the grey line shows the estimated warming from the combination of all the different types of forcings.\n The effects of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a (ENSO) events was removed from the observations using an approach adapted from Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) and the Kaplan El Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index when calculating the volcanic temperature response, as the overlap between volcanoes and ENSO otherwise complicates empirical estimates.\n"

Sun, 2021: Moreover, any attribution of possible human influence on the Atlantic modes and associated teleconnections is limited by the poor fidelity of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models in reproducing the mean tropical Atlantic climate, its seasonality and variability, despite hints of some improvement in CMIP6, as well as other sources of uncertainties related to limited process understanding in the observations (Foltz et al., 2019), the response of the tropical Atlantic climate to anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Booth et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013a) and the presence of strong multi-decadal fluctuations related to AMV (Section 3.7.7) and cross-tropical basin interactions (Mart\u00edn-Rey et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019). The IPCC SRCCL, however, noted the remaining shortcomings of carbon cycle schemes in ESMs (Jia et al., 2019), which for example do not properly incorporate thermal responses of respiration and photosynthesis, and frequently omit representations of permafrost thaw (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018), the nitrogen cycle (R.Q. Thomas et al., 2015) and its influence on vegetation dynamics (Jeffers et al., 2015), the phosphorus cycle (Fleischer et al., 2019), and accurate implications of carbon store changes for a range of land use and land management options (Erb et al., 2018; Harper et al., 2018) (see Sections 5.2.1.4.1 and 5.4, Figure 5.24 and Table 5.4 for details).\n This chapter additionally builds on the assessment of attribution of global temperatures contained in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5; IPCC, 2018), assessments of attribution of changes in the ocean and cryosphere in the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b), and assessments of attribution of changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL, IPCC, 2019a).\n With the recent increase in ocean sampling by Argo to 2000 m (Roemmich et al., 2015; Riser et al., 2016; von Schuckmann et al., 2016) and the resulting improvements in estimates of ocean heat content (Abraham et al., 2013; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Durack et al., 2014b; Cheng et al., 2017; von Schuckmann et al., 2020), a more quantitative assessment of the global ocean heat content changes that extends into the intermediate ocean (700\u20132000 m) over the more recent period (from 2005 to the present; Durack et al., 2018) can be performed."

The first terrestrial applications in the 1970s were in remote locations where the connection to the wider electrical grid is costly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lighthouses, remote railroad crossings, or the refrigeration of vaccines.13\nThe data point for 1976 in the top left corner of the chart shows the state of solar technology at the time.\n Carbon pricing is a policy that would make those who actually cause emissions pay for them (the richest people in the world that enjoy the best living conditions in human history), but most governments fail to implement carbon prices, and where they exist they are often too low (which has the consequence that the poorest people on the planet are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpaying\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most for carbon emissions, since it is them who are suffering the severest consequences).\n This chart is from my colleague Hannah Ritchie; she documents in her article that the price of batteries declined by 97% in the last three decades.39\nAt their current price there might only be demand for five large power storage systems in the world, but as a prediction for the future this might sound foolish one day (if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m alluding to, you skipped reading the text in the fold-out box above).\n"

Some of this is due to the direct effects of aerosols on solar radiation, and some is due to the effects of aerosols on cloud properties (the so-called \u201cindirect\u201d effects of aerosols).\n The cosmic ray hypothesis\nThe base proposition is that cosmic rays, or charged particles from space (predominantly protons), enhance the formation of tiny new particles in the upper atmosphere.\n"

The panel warns that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all aspects of the climate system. \"Trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends,\" the report says.

Sun, 2021: Moreover, any attribution of possible human influence on the Atlantic modes and associated teleconnections is limited by the poor fidelity of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models in reproducing the mean tropical Atlantic climate, its seasonality and variability, despite hints of some improvement in CMIP6, as well as other sources of uncertainties related to limited process understanding in the observations (Foltz et al., 2019), the response of the tropical Atlantic climate to anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Booth et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013a) and the presence of strong multi-decadal fluctuations related to AMV (Section 3.7.7) and cross-tropical basin interactions (Mart\u00edn-Rey et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019). The IPCC SRCCL, however, noted the remaining shortcomings of carbon cycle schemes in ESMs (Jia et al., 2019), which for example do not properly incorporate thermal responses of respiration and photosynthesis, and frequently omit representations of permafrost thaw (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018), the nitrogen cycle (R.Q. Thomas et al., 2015) and its influence on vegetation dynamics (Jeffers et al., 2015), the phosphorus cycle (Fleischer et al., 2019), and accurate implications of carbon store changes for a range of land use and land management options (Erb et al., 2018; Harper et al., 2018) (see Sections 5.2.1.4.1 and 5.4, Figure 5.24 and Table 5.4 for details).\n This chapter additionally builds on the assessment of attribution of global temperatures contained in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR1.5; IPCC, 2018), assessments of attribution of changes in the ocean and cryosphere in the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b), and assessments of attribution of changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL, IPCC, 2019a).\n With the recent increase in ocean sampling by Argo to 2000 m (Roemmich et al., 2015; Riser et al., 2016; von Schuckmann et al., 2016) and the resulting improvements in estimates of ocean heat content (Abraham et al., 2013; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Durack et al., 2014b; Cheng et al., 2017; von Schuckmann et al., 2020), a more quantitative assessment of the global ocean heat content changes that extends into the intermediate ocean (700\u20132000 m) over the more recent period (from 2005 to the present; Durack et al., 2018) can be performed."

Outside of renewable energy, scattered but numerous examples are available on the role of innovative public policy to spur and create new markets and technologies (Arent et al. 2017): (i) proactive role of the state in energy transitions (e.g., the retirement of all coal-fired power plants in Ontario, Canada, between 2007 and 2014 (Kern and Rogge 2016; Sovacool 2016)); (ii) too early exit and design problems not considering the market acceptability and financing issues (e.g., energy-efficient retrofitting in housing in UK (Rosenow and Eyre 2016), low or negative returns in reality versus engineering estimates in weatherisation programmes in US (Fowlie et al. 2018)); and (iii) energy performance contracting for sharing the business risks and profits and improving energy efficiency (energy service companies (Bertoldi and Boza-Kiss 2017; Qin et al. 2017) and utility energy service contracts in the USA (Clark 2018)).\n 3.\ncoordination of project preparation and development of project pipelines by infrastructure coordinator agencies, one-stop structuring and financing shops, project risk facilities provided by entities such as cities\u2019 development banks, green banks, a world climate bank, global guarantee mechanism, and global infrastructure investment platform;\n4.\ndevelopment of local currency bond markets backed by cross-border guarantees, technical assistance, remediation assets, especially by regional and national players whose mandates include nurturing local capital markets to support bond yield curve development and exchange listing options;\n5.\nadopting advances in science-based assessment methods to foster accountability;\n(a)\nfor project assessment, measuring, reporting and verifying, and certification,\n(b)\nfor disclosures in climate, fossil fuels, SDGs, debt transparency and debt sustainability, and\n(c)\nfor progress on UN systems of national accounts particularly for public sector finance statistics.\n An important immediate finding from the COVID-19 crisis was that the slowdown in economic activity is illustrating some of these choices: immediately after the onset, more costly and carbon-intensive coal use for energy use tumbled in major countries such as China and the USA, while the forced \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 policies adopted around the major economies of the world led to a \u201330\u201335% decline in individual country GDP, and was in turn associated with a decrease in daily global CO2 emissions by \u201326% at their peak in individual countries, and \u201317% globally (\u201311 to \u201325% for \u00b11\u03c3) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, with just under half coming from changes in surface transport, city congestion and country mobility (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. 2020)."

In 2021, the increase in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion corresponded with an increase in energy use as a result of economic activity rebounding after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to an increase in coal use in the electric power sector.\n The impact of 1 pound of N2O on warming the atmosphere is 265 times that of 1 pound of carbon dioxide.1\nGlobally, 40% of total N2O emissions come from human activities.2 Nitrous oxide is emitted from agriculture, land use, transportation, industry, and other activities, described below.\n"

When asked what they regard as \"the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years,\" on a scale of 1 to 10, from Trivial to Catastrophic: 13% of respondents replied 1 to 3 (trivial/mild), 44% replied 4 to 7 (moderate), 41% replied 8 to 10 (severe/catastrophic), and 2% didn't know.[108]\nIn 2012, James L. Powell, a former member of the National Science Board, analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24\n(<0.2%) rejected anthropogenic global warming.[109][110][111][112] This was a follow-up to an analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed articles published between November 2012 and December 2013, which revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.[113][114][115]\nDennis Bray and Hans von Storch had conducted their fourth survey in 2013, publishing its results the following year.\n No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.[10] A few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions,[11] and some have tried to persuade the public that climate change is not happening, or if the climate is changing it is not because of human influence,[12][13] attempting to sow doubt in the scientific consensus (see climate change denial).[14]\nExistence of a scientific consensus\nA question that frequently arose in popular discussion was whether there is a scientific consensus on climate change.[19]\nSeveral scientific organizations have explicitly used the term \"consensus\" in their statements:\nConsensus points\nThe current scientific consensus is that:\nChanges in global temperature are usually expressed in terms of temperature anomalies: \"In climate change studies, temperature anomalies are more important than absolute temperature. \", it went from 4.17 to 3.62.[90] Notably, the percentage of respondents \"strongly disagreeing\" stayed the same, at 10%, and a similar percentage stayed neutral (14% in 1996 and 13% in 2003): yet, the overall split went from 41% agreement and 45% disagreement in 1996 to 56% agreement and 30% disagreement in 2003, as there was both a substantial increase in agreement and a decline percentage of those disagreeing less strongly.[91] Similarly, there was a 72% to 20% split in favour of describing the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that \"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions.\". There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.[84]\nSurveys of scientists' views on climate change\nSurveys of scientists' views on climate change \u2013 with a focus on human-caused or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) \u2013 have been undertaken since the 1970s.[30][31] A 2016 paper (which was co-authored by Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton and John Cook, and which was based on a half a dozen independent studies by the authors) concluded that \"the finding of 97% consensus [that humans are causing recent global warming] in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies."

However, climate models have become more reliable, and a new field of science has developed to determine how climate change directly impacts extreme weather events: extreme event attribution.

(2021) conclude that their counts also show little evidence of a long-term increase (since the 1880s) after accounting for changes in observing system capabilities; they also show that U.S. landfalling major hurricanes (with no adjustment) have no significant increasing trend since the late 1800s.\nFigure 4 (from Vecchi et al. 2021) suggests that after adjusting for changes in observing capabilities (limited ship observations) in the pre-satellite era, there is no significant long-term trend (since the 1880s) in the proportion of hurricanes that become major hurricanes.\u00a0  If this statistical relation between tropical Atlantic SSTs and hurricane activity is used to infer future changes in Atlantic hurricane activity, the implications are sobering: the large increases in tropical Atlantic SSTs projected for the late 21st century would imply very substantial increases in hurricane destructive potential\u2013roughly a 300% increase in the PDI by 2100 (Figure 1 from Vecchi et al. (2008), orange curve).\n In the latter case, the relative SST measure (lower panel) does not change very much over the 21st century, even with substantial Atlantic warming projections from climate models, because, crucially, the warming projected for the tropical Atlantic in the models is not very different from that projected for the tropics as a whole.\n F. Summary for Atlantic Hurricanes and Global Warming\nIn summary, neither our model projections for the 21st century nor our analyses of trends in Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm activity support the notion that greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers in the Atlantic.\u00a0  Turning now to the question of the frequency of very intense hurricanes, Bender et al. 2010 and Knutson et al. 2013, obtained tropical storm genesis information from an\u00a0 Atlantic basin regional model (Knutson et al. 2008),\u00a0 and then downscaling all of the individual storms from the regional model into the GFDL hurricane prediction system."

For example, consider tree-ring data from two different sources: the first is a tree that sprouted in the 1850s and was recently cut down, the second is one-hundred years worth of growth ring patterns in a wood beam from a log cabin that was built in the 1870s.

As shown in the chart above, the rate of warming between 1970 and 2016 in the TAR was about 14% lower than what has actually been observed.\n This was likely due to a combination of two factors: a lower climate sensitivity than found in modern estimates (2.5C vs. 3C) and an overestimate of the radiative forcing of CO2 (4.37 watts per square meter versus 3.7 used in the subsequent IPCC report and still used today).\n"

(2008), orange curve).\n In the latter case, the relative SST measure (lower panel) does not change very much over the 21st century, even with substantial Atlantic warming projections from climate models, because, crucially, the warming projected for the tropical Atlantic in the models is not very different from that projected for the tropics as a whole.\n F. Summary for Atlantic Hurricanes and Global Warming\nIn summary, neither our model projections for the 21st century nor our analyses of trends in Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm activity support the notion that greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to large increases in either tropical storm or overall hurricane numbers in the Atlantic.\u00a0  Turning now to the question of the frequency of very intense hurricanes, Bender et al. 2010 and Knutson et al. 2013, obtained tropical storm genesis information from an\u00a0 Atlantic basin regional model (Knutson et al. 2008),\u00a0 and then downscaling all of the individual storms from the regional model into the GFDL hurricane prediction system."

But an unusual number of those storms have made landfall in the U.S. When Hurricane Milton reaches Florida, it will be the fifth named storm to make landfall in the U.S. this year.

All of these human activities add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, trapping more heat than usual and contributing to global warming. Even if we reduce greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to their 2000 levels, we can still expect a warming of about 0.1 degree Celsius (0.18 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a critical step in slowing the global warming trend.

While no one is safe from these risks, the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis are the people who contribute least to its causes, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it: people in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities.\n Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. WHO leads the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH), bringing together a range of health and development partners, to support countries in achieving their commitments to climate-resilient and low carbon health systems.\n These weather and climate hazards affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies.\n"

Methane (CH4) emissions\nWhere does methane come from?\nAgriculture, fossil fuel production, and the management of waste are the primary sources of methane emissions:\nWhat is the warming potential of methane compared to CO2?\nMethane is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 in terms of its 'warming potential'.

In fact, the 20th century was the warmest of the past 10 centuries, and the decade 2011\u201320 was the warmest decade since the beginning of modern instrumental record keeping. Carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases, and they have a profound effect on the energy budget of the Earth system despite making up only a fraction of all atmospheric gases. Greenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are gas molecules that have the property of absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth\u2019s surface and reradiating it back to Earth\u2019s surface, thus contributing to the phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Feedback\nPerhaps the most intensively discussed and researched topic in climate variability is the role of interactions and feedbacks among the various components of the Earth system."

Even if we reduce greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to their 2000 levels, we can still expect a warming of about 0.1 degree Celsius (0.18 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a critical step in slowing the global warming trend.

Sun, 2021: Moreover, any attribution of possible human influence on the Atlantic modes and associated teleconnections is limited by the poor fidelity of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models in reproducing the mean tropical Atlantic climate, its seasonality and variability, despite hints of some improvement in CMIP6, as well as other sources of uncertainties related to limited process understanding in the observations (Foltz et al., 2019), the response of the tropical Atlantic climate to anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Booth et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013a) and the presence of strong multi-decadal fluctuations related to AMV (Section 3.7.7) and cross-tropical basin interactions (Mart\u00edn-Rey et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019). The IPCC SRCCL, however, noted the remaining shortcomings of carbon cycle schemes in ESMs (Jia et al., 2019), which for example do not properly incorporate thermal responses of respiration and photosynthesis, and frequently omit representations of permafrost thaw (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018), the nitrogen cycle (R.Q.

In 2015, the UNFCCC's \"structured expert dialogue\" came to the conclusion that, \"in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C\".[329] Together with the strong diplomatic voice of the poorest countries and the island nations in the Pacific, this expert finding was the driving force leading to the decision of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference to lay down this 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C long-term target on top of the existing 2\u00a0\u00b0C goal.[330]\nSociety and culture[edit]\nCommitments to divest[edit]\nMore than 1000 organizations with investments worth US$8 trillion have made commitments to fossil fuel divestment.[332] Socially responsible investing funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards.[333]\nBarriers[edit]\nThere are individual, institutional and market barriers to achieving climate change mitigation.[98]:\u200a Globally the cost of limiting warming to 2\u00a0\u00b0C is less than the value of the extra years of life due to cleaner air - and in India and China much less.[265]\nIn the transportation sector mitigation strategies could enable more equitable access to transportation services and reduce congestion.[5]:\u200aSPM-32\nAddressing inequality can assist with climate change mitigation efforts.[5]:\u200a38\u200a Placing health as a key focus of the Nationally Determined Contributions could present an opportunity to increase ambition and realise health co-benefits.[265]\nClimate change adaptation[edit]\n It is the main emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2).[46]:\u200a6\u20136\u200a Rapid and deep reductions in the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector are necessary to limit global warming to well below 2\u00a0\u00b0C.[46]:\u200a6\u20133\u200a IPCC recommendations include reducing fossil fuel consumption, increasing production from low- and zero carbon energy sources, and increasing use of electricity and alternative energy carriers.[46]:\u200a6\u20133\nNearly all scenarios and strategies involve a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures.[47]:\u200axxiii\u200a  The economic potential of these activities has been estimated to be 4.2 to 7.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2 -eq) per year.[5]:\u200a37\nForests[edit]\nThe Stern Review on the economics of climate change stated in 2007 that curbing deforestation was a highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.[135] About 95% of deforestation occurs in the tropics, where clearing of land for agriculture is one of the main causes.[136]"

We know from both its rapid increase and its isotopic \u201cfingerprint\u201d that the source of this new carbon dioxide is fossil fuels, and not natural sources like forest fires, volcanoes, or outgassing from the ocean.\n We know the world is warming because people have been recording daily high and low temperatures at thousands of weather stations worldwide, over land and ocean, for many decades and, in some locations, for more than a century.

The increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol content in the atmosphere result in a change in the radiative forcing to which the climate system must act to restore the radiative balance.

Methane (CH4) emissions\nWhere does methane come from?\nAgriculture, fossil fuel production, and the management of waste are the primary sources of methane emissions:\nWhat is the warming potential of methane compared to CO2?\nMethane is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 in terms of its 'warming potential'. They have proposed a new way to represent short-lived greenhouse gas emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c GWP* \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which aims to be more representative of warming response.10,11 Dr Michelle Cain, one of the lead researchers in this area, discusses the challenges of GHG metrics and the role of a new GWP* metric, in an article in the Carbon Briefhere.\n GWP can be defined on a range of time-periods, however the most commonly used (and that adopted by the IPCC) is the 100-year timescale (GWP100).13\nIn the chart we see the GWP100 value of key greenhouse gases relative to carbon dioxide. Using this GWP100 metric can therefore misrepresent the impact of short-lived gases such as methane in both directions.9 \u00c2\u00a0It underestimates short-term warming: the warming impact of methane when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first emitted and the following years is much higher than the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc28\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 value assigned by GWP100."

In 2021, the increase in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion corresponded with an increase in energy use as a result of economic activity rebounding after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to an increase in coal use in the electric power sector.\n The impact of 1 pound of N2O on warming the atmosphere is 265 times that of 1 pound of carbon dioxide.1\nGlobally, 40% of total N2O emissions come from human activities.2 Nitrous oxide is emitted from agriculture, land use, transportation, industry, and other activities, described below.\n"

Last year, fossil fuel emissions were at record highs, while the natural world struggled to absorb as much CO2 due to factors including wildfires and drought, so more accumulated in the atmosphere. \"Even without the boost from El Ni\u00f1o last year, the CO2 rise driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation would now be outpacing the [UN climate body] IPCC's 1.5C scenarios,\" says Prof Betts.

While the prevailing scientific consensus and evidence attributes modern climate change to human activity, some analysts argue that Earth\u2019s climate has always undergone natural fluctuations and that recent changes are within the bounds of historical variability. Climate change skeptics often suggest that current warming trends may partly result from natural solar fluctuations rather than human activities, however, the same has been debunked by NASA. The unprecedented rise in global temperatures, coupled with the highest carbon dioxide levels in 2 million years, highlights a significant departure from natural climate cycles, emphasizing the dominant role of human influence and reinforcing the importance of implementing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies."

To calculate consumption-based emissions we need to track which goods are traded across the world, and whenever a good was imported we need to include all CO2 emissions that were emitted in the production of that good, and vice versa to subtract all CO2 emissions that were emitted in the production of goods that were exported.\n The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total CO2 emissions9 are shown on the basis of two axes: the height of the bar (y-axis) is the average per capita CO2 emissions and the length of the box (x This is because a large fraction of CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years once emitted.4\nThis inequality is one of the main reasons which makes international agreement on who should take action so challenging.\nConsumption-based (trade-adjusted) emissions\nCO2 emissions are typically measured on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproduction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122."

            "content": "The leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\n In the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\n A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much."

Changes in sea surface temperature can shift storm tracks, potentially contributing to droughts in some areas.5 Increases in sea surface temperature\u00a0are also expected to lengthen the growth season for certain bacteria that can contaminate seafood and cause foodborne illnesses, thereby increasing the risk of health effects.6\nAbout the Indicator\nThis indicator tracks average global sea surface temperature from 1880 through 2020. The shaded band shows the range of uncertainty in the data, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used.\n Increases in sea surface temperature have led to an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor over the oceans.4\u00a0This water vapor feeds weather systems that produce precipitation, increasing the risk of heavy rain and snow (see the Heavy Precipitation and Tropical Cyclone Activity indicators). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has carefully reconstructed and filtered the data in Figure 1 to correct for biases in the different collection techniques and to minimize the effects of sampling changes over various locations and times."

The local weather that impacts our daily lives results from large global patterns in the atmosphere caused by the interactions of solar radiation, Earth's large ocean, diverse landscapes, and motion in space.\n In the Northern Hemisphere air veers to the right and in the Southern Hemisphere to the left. About 2000 miles from the equator, the air falls back to Earth's surface blowing towards the pole and back to the equator. High in the atmosphere, narrow bands of strong wind, such as the jet streams, steer weather systems and transfer heat and moisture around the globe.\n"

Methane (CH4) emissions\nWhere does methane come from?\nAgriculture, fossil fuel production, and the management of waste are the primary sources of methane emissions:\nWhat is the warming potential of methane compared to CO2?\nMethane is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 in terms of its 'warming potential'. They have proposed a new way to represent short-lived greenhouse gas emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c GWP* \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which aims to be more representative of warming response.10,11 Dr Michelle Cain, one of the lead researchers in this area, discusses the challenges of GHG metrics and the role of a new GWP* metric, in an article in the Carbon Briefhere.\n GWP can be defined on a range of time-periods, however the most commonly used (and that adopted by the IPCC) is the 100-year timescale (GWP100).13\nIn the chart we see the GWP100 value of key greenhouse gases relative to carbon dioxide. Using this GWP100 metric can therefore misrepresent the impact of short-lived gases such as methane in both directions.9 \u00c2\u00a0It underestimates short-term warming: the warming impact of methane when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first emitted and the following years is much higher than the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc28\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 value assigned by GWP100."

The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.\n In the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\n A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much."

Jet streams are strongest in the winter because temperature contrasts are greater. Other Jet Streams How a Jet Stream Works The two key players in jet stream formation are temperature gradients and the Earth\u2019s rotation. Combining the temperature-driven pressure differences with the Coriolis effect results in the formation of jet streams. This westerly flow of air, concentrated in a narrow band, is a jet stream.

The result is that the farther the air moves from the equator, the faster and faster east it moves relative to the Earth's surface below.\n The momentum the air has as it travels around the Earth is conserved, which means that as the air over the equator starts moving toward one of the poles, it keeps its eastward motion constant."

There is of course a large literature on measurement and modeling of declining Arctic sea-ice extent and area, and insightful overviews include\u00a0Stroeve et al.

            "content": "Since the Industrial Revolution approximately 150 years ago, human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have begun to have an effect on the carbon cycle and the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Human activities affect the carbon cycle through emissions of carbon dioxide (sources) and removal of carbon dioxide (sinks). The carbon cycle can be affected when carbon dioxide is either released into the atmosphere or removed from the atmosphere. Human activity in managing farmland or forests affects the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by plants and trees. Human activity can affect the carbon cycle by capturing carbon dioxide and storing it underground rather than permitting it to be released into the atmosphere.

If the transient simulations are performed, the patterns of temperature/precipitation changes in response to GHGs changes would be similar to those obtained through the current equilibrium simulations following SSP1-1.9, but the responses to GHGs changes would be even weaker in transient simulations as compared to equilibrium simulations47, which would not alter the finding in this study that the climate effects of aerosol reductions far outweigh those of GHGs under carbon neutrality."

A closer look at the carbon dioxide measurements at Mauna Loa shows a series of wiggles in the data. Spring growth starts in September and winter decomposition begins in March, so CO2 records in the Southern Hemisphere show the opposite pattern of that seen in Mauna Loa. However, because there is a lot more land and vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere than the southern, the global seasonal cycle more closely aligns with the northern pattern.

Even if we reduce greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions to their 2000 levels, we can still expect a warming of about 0.1 degree Celsius (0.18 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a critical step in slowing the global warming trend.

According to Tompkins and Di Giuseppe27, in the calculation of the total clouds cover \\(\\varepsilon\\) there are three options in their formation: clouds that were formed through coherent dynamic processes (mainly convection) and that overlap in a maximum way, in this case the total cloud cover is \\(\\varepsilon =Max\\left\\{{\\varepsilon }_{L}, {\\varepsilon }_{M}, {\\varepsilon }_{H}\\right\\}\\); clouds that are formed in a random way, in a way this represents that the processes that take place in their formation at each level are not well known, in this case averaging a very large number of possible overlap scenarios, the total cloud cover will be given on average by \\(\\varepsilon =1-\\left(1-{\\varepsilon }_{L}\\right)\\left(1-{\\varepsilon }_{M}\\right)(1-{\\varepsilon }_{H})\\); finally, the third option considers that the clouds in each layer overlap minimally, in theory this could occur if the presence of a cloud at one level leads to a lower probability that there is a nearby cloud at the other level, possibly due to processes of suppression, in this case we have \\(\\varepsilon =Min\\left\\{{\\varepsilon }_{L}+{\\varepsilon }_{M}+{\\varepsilon }_{H},1\\right\\}\\). The third option can lead to the error of overestimating the cloud cover; but it may be an acceptable option when considering the total cloud cover formed only by low and medium clouds, since the increase in low clouds suppresses the increase in medium clouds due to the lack of vapor at this level, which condensed at the level of low clouds, the opposite occurs when there is a decrease in low clouds, in which case the excess vapor at this level can condense at the level of the middle clouds, giving an increase in clouds at this level20.

By performing a statistical analysis on their first correlation, the UK researchers concluded that no more than 23% of the reduction in global low cloud cover at the time of the 1990 solar maximum was caused by the lower cosmic ray flux, pointing out that there are all sorts of other effects that could have been to blame instead.

At the same time, higher temperatures and shifting climate patterns may change the areas where crops grow best and affect the makeup of natural plant communities.\n Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric CO2.

In fact, the 20th century was the warmest of the past 10 centuries, and the decade 2011\u201320 was the warmest decade since the beginning of modern instrumental record keeping. Carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases, and they have a profound effect on the energy budget of the Earth system despite making up only a fraction of all atmospheric gases. Greenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are gas molecules that have the property of absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth\u2019s surface and reradiating it back to Earth\u2019s surface, thus contributing to the phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.

Trump has already said he plans to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement \u2013 the legally binding UN treaty on climate change \u2013 and may even pull the country out of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u00a0(UNFCCC), which underpins global action to tackle climate change. In November 2024, countries at COP29 agreed on a new climate finance goal of $300bn (\u00a3242bn) per year by 2035 to help developing countries transition to a greener economy and cope with the impacts of climate change."

The precipitation outlook again (as it did in January) resembles a La Ni\u00f1a-like response over the key winter teleconnection regions of the U.S. Specifically, the February outlook favors above-average precipitation in the Pacific Northwest, across the northern Rockies, and in an expansive area which includes most of the Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, interior portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and also in western and northern Alaska. Given ongoing La Ni\u00f1a conditions and the monthly forecast favoring above-average precipitation across parts of the northern half of the country, drought improvement (with some removal) during February is likely in the northern Rockies, parts of the Midwest, and in parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast."

A systematic literature analysis was done by focusing on 1) soil-plant-atmosphere nexus, 2) climate change impacts on soil dynamics, 3) climate stressors and plant responses, and 4) soil-plant-atmosphere feedback mechanisms, with specific criteria for data on extreme weather events, changed nutrient cycles, and CO2-related alterations and temperature-related changes. Key findings reveal that climate-induced disruptions such as altered precipitation, increased temperatures, and extreme weather events weaken soil structure, damage nutrient cycling, and modify plant growth, thereby threatening agricultural productivity and ecosystem stability."

While the prevailing scientific consensus and evidence attributes modern climate change to human activity, some analysts argue that Earth\u2019s climate has always undergone natural fluctuations and that recent changes are within the bounds of historical variability. Climate change skeptics often suggest that current warming trends may partly result from natural solar fluctuations rather than human activities, however, the same has been debunked by NASA. The unprecedented rise in global temperatures, coupled with the highest carbon dioxide levels in 2 million years, highlights a significant departure from natural climate cycles, emphasizing the dominant role of human influence and reinforcing the importance of implementing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies."

As shown in the chart above, the rate of warming between 1970 and 2016 in the TAR was about 14% lower than what has actually been observed.\n This was likely due to a combination of two factors: a lower climate sensitivity than found in modern estimates (2.5C vs. 3C) and an overestimate of the radiative forcing of CO2 (4.37 watts per square meter versus 3.7 used in the subsequent IPCC report and still used today).\n"

Can the plants that sustain our food supply, supply oxygen and cool our planet repair the damage done to the earth in support of solar energy like it can mitigate carbon in the atmosphere and maintain the life sustaining balance experienced on earth for millenniums?\n That is to say, in the real context of intense human development pressure that broadly threatens habitat and biodiversity, the destabilization and fragmentation of habitat has the potential to threaten plant communities, in combination with the background environmental changes related to climate change. Carbon and other Green House Gases can be captured and put directly into the soil \u2026see how this is being done in Africa with the help of the diesel tractor and how these African farmers do not use any fertilizer https://www.carbon-farmer.com/ Please do not simply dismiss the use of the diesel."

The precipitation outlook again (as it did in January) resembles a La Ni\u00f1a-like response over the key winter teleconnection regions of the U.S. Specifically, the February outlook favors above-average precipitation in the Pacific Northwest, across the northern Rockies, and in an expansive area which includes most of the Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, interior portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and also in western and northern Alaska. Given ongoing La Ni\u00f1a conditions and the monthly forecast favoring above-average precipitation across parts of the northern half of the country, drought improvement (with some removal) during February is likely in the northern Rockies, parts of the Midwest, and in parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast."

La Ni\u00f1a\u2019s signature is cooler-than-average surface water in the east-central Equatorial Pacific, while its counterpart, El Ni\u00f1o, features warmer-than-average surface water. To be categorized as a La Ni\u00f1a event in our historical record, the three-month-average Ni\u00f1o-3.4 Index (the Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index) needs to stay at least 0.5 \u00b0C below average for at least five consecutive, overlapping seasons. Can La Ni\u00f1a still affect our winter climate?

Laboratory experiments in which the pH of seawater has been lowered to approximately 7.8 (to simulate one projected oceanic pH for the year 2100) have shown that such organisms placed in these environments do not grow as well as those placed in environments characterized by early 21st-century levels of seawater acidity (pH = 8.05). ocean acidification,\nthe worldwide reduction in the pH of seawater as a consequence of the absorption of large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) by the oceans.

In 1998, scientist Michael Mann, then at the University of Massachusetts\u2013Amherst, and colleagues published a detailed temperature record that formed the basis of what came to be known as the \u201chockey stick\u201d graph, so named because the chart showed a sharp rise in temperatures (the hockey blade) at the end of a long, much flatter period (the hockey stick). From their viewpoint in the sky, satellites have measured the steady rise in global sea level \u2014 currently 3.4 millimeters per year and accelerating, as warming water expands and as ice sheets melt \u2014 as well as the rapid decline in ice left floating on the Arctic Ocean each summer at the end of the melt season. The abundance of certain forms, or isotopes, of oxygen and hydrogen in the ice allows scientists to calculate the temperature at which it formed, and air bubbles trapped within the ice reveal how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were in the atmosphere at that time. An important breakthrough came in 1967, when Manabe and Richard Wetherald \u2014 both at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, a lab born from Charney\u2019s group \u2014 published a paper in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences that modeled connections between Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere and calculated how changes in carbon dioxide would affect the planet\u2019s temperature."

For example, air pollutants are diluted and dispersed in a horizontal direction by prevailing winds, and they are dispersed in a vertical direction by atmospheric instability. Unstable atmospheric conditions occur when air masses move naturally in a vertical direction, thereby mixing and dispersing pollutants. In the troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere, where most weather occurs), air temperatures normally decrease as altitude increases; the faster the rate of decrease, the more unstable the atmosphere. Under certain conditions, however, a temporary \u201ctemperature inversion\u201d may occur, during which time the air temperature increases with increasing altitude, and the atmosphere is very stable."

According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.\n A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much."

The changes in surface temperature variability occur with the increase of the air\u2013sea coupling strength (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Fig. 1d,e) by the increase in open ocean area from sea-ice loss. We perform the multitaper power spectrum analysis on the annual mean Arctic surface temperature anomaly for each ensemble member (Extended Data Fig. 2) and compile the results by their GMST level (Methods). Next, we investigate the detailed characteristics of the oscillation using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) 1.0.4 experiments from the LongRunMIP ensemble, which show pronounced changes in the surface temperature variability in a warm climate."

To calculate consumption-based emissions we need to track which goods are traded across the world, and whenever a good was imported we need to include all CO2 emissions that were emitted in the production of that good, and vice versa to subtract all CO2 emissions that were emitted in the production of goods that were exported.\n The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total CO2 emissions9 are shown on the basis of two axes: the height of the bar (y-axis) is the average per capita CO2 emissions and the length of the box (x This is because a large fraction of CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years once emitted.4\nThis inequality is one of the main reasons which makes international agreement on who should take action so challenging.\nConsumption-based (trade-adjusted) emissions\nCO2 emissions are typically measured on the basis of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproduction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122."
