transmission has biosafety implications because a major concern associated with the risk of working with emerging viruses in the laboratory is the generation of aerosols from various laboratory activities which are not immediately recognizable and may affect other scientific personnel.[56] Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another possible cause of infection.[57] Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, but it does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours.[10] The virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilizes its lipid bilayer.[58][59] Viral RNA has also been found in stool samples and semen from infected individuals.[60][61]\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the incubation period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the pharynx reaches peak viral load approximately four days after infection[62][63] or in the first week of symptoms and declines thereafter.[64] The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset.[65]\nA study by a team of researchers from the University of North Carolina found that the nasal cavity is seemingly the dominant initial site of infection, with subsequent aspiration-mediated virus-seeding into the lungs in SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 pathogenesis.[66] They found that there was an infection gradient from high in proximal towards low in distal pulmonary epithelial cultures, with a focal infection in ciliated cells and type 2 pneumocytes in the airway and alveolar regions respectively.[66]\nStudies have identified a range of animals\u2014such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits\u2014that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.[67][68][69] Some institutions have advised that those infected with SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 restrict their contact with animals.[70][71]\nAsymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission\nOn 1\u00a0February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".[72] One meta-analysis found that 17% of infections are asymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the virus.[73]\nHowever, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the outbreak in China suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that subclinical infections may have been the source of a majority of infections.[74] That may explain how out of 217 on board a cruise liner that docked at Montevideo, only 24 of 128 who tested positive for viral RNA showed symptoms.[75] Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients began shedding virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\".[54] ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins.[131][132]\nPhylogenetic tree\nA phylogenetic tree based on whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is:[133][134]\n(Bat) Rc-o319, 81% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus cornutus, Iwate, Japan[135]\nBat SL-ZXC21, 88% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus pusillus, Zhoushan, Zhejiang[136]\nBat SL-ZC45, 88% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus pusillus, Zhoushan, Zhejiang[136]\nPangolin SARSr-CoV-GX, 85.3% to SARS-CoV-2, Manis javanica, smuggled from Southeast Asia[137]\nPangolin SARSr-CoV-GD, 90.1% to SARS-CoV-2, Manis javanica, smuggled from Southeast Asia[138]\nBat RshSTT182, 92.6% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus shameli, Steung Treng, Cambodia[139]\nBat RshSTT200, 92.6% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus shameli, Steung Treng, Cambodia[139]\n(Bat) RacCS203, 91.5% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus acuminatus, Chachoengsao, Thailand[134]\n(Bat) RmYN02, 93.3% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus malayanus, Mengla, Yunnan[140]\n(Bat) RpYN06, 94.4% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus pusillus, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan[133]\n(Bat) RaTG13, 96.1% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus affinis, Mojiang, Yunnan[141]\n(Bat) BANAL-52, 96.8% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus malayanus, Vientiane, Laos[142]\nSARS-CoV-2\nSARS-CoV-1, 79% to SARS-CoV-2\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades.[143] A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.[124] Examination of the topology of the phylogenetic tree at the start of the pandemic also found high similarities between human isolates.[125]\nAs of 21\u00a0August\u00a02021,[update] 3,422 SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available.[126]\nOn 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. None of the above are its direct ancestor.[97]\nBats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112.[87][98] Differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 suggest that humans may have been infected via an intermediate host;[85] although the source of introduction into humans remains unknown.[99][80]\nAlthough the role of pangolins as an intermediate host was initially posited (a study published in July 2020 suggested that pangolins are an intermediate host of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112-like coronaviruses[100][101]), subsequent studies have not substantiated their contribution to the spillover.[87] Evidence against this hypothesis includes the fact that pangolin virus samples are too distant to SARS-CoV-2: isolates obtained from pangolins seized in Guangdong were only 92% identical in sequence to the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 genome (matches above 90 percent may sound high, but in genomic terms it is a wide evolutionary gap[102])."

Recently, LY6E was shown to impair infection by SARS-CoV, SAR-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV by inhibiting the S protein-mediated membrane fusion, and mice lacking LY6E expression in immune cells were highly susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus, also a coronavirus150."

Loss of Taste and Smell after COVID-19\nThe senses of smell and taste are related, and because the coronavirus can affect cells in the nose, having COVID-19 can result in lost or distorted senses of smell (anosmia) or taste. Millions more people have had COVID-19 than SARS or MERS, so the potential problem of lingering health problems is huge, particularly in the context of the pandemic, with isolation, economic disadvantage, lack of access and changed daily routines further compounding the complexities of long-term COVID-19 care.\n When should I see a doctor about post-COVID-19 symptoms?\nLong-term COVID-19 symptoms can be similar to signs of other disease, so it is important to see your doctor and rule out other problems, such as cardiac issues or lung disease.\n"

This injury may arise from several mechanisms: direct viral effects, where SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiac cells, causing cellular damage and inflammation; systemic inflammation, triggered by the virus and often resulting in a cytokine storm that can damage myocardial tissue and disrupt cardiac function; endothelial dysfunction, where COVID-19 causes endothelial cell activation and microvascular thrombosis, contributing to myocardial ischemia and injury; and increased cardiac demand, where respiratory distress associated with COVID-19 places additional strain on the heart, exacerbating myocardial injury."

The passive transfer of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from the plasma of recently recovered individuals (COVID-19 convalescent plasma) to patients with severe COVID-19 was among the first therapies used.5-7 There is now substantial evidence suggesting that such antibody-based therapy, when administered early in the disease course (ie, within 72 hours since the onset of symptoms) and with high titers of neutralizing antibodies, is associated with a clinical benefit\u2014 including decreases in incidences of disease progression, hospitalization, and mortality.8,9\n The summary of findings tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE approach, which defines the certainty of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 Tool for randomized clinical trials23 and the Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for matched cohort studies.24 For both risk of bias assessment tools, each domain can score low risk if there is no indication for risk of bias, some concerns if there is potential for risk of bias, or high risk if there is clear indication for risk of bias."

We thank Jeff LaFleur, MA, and his team at the Einstein/Montefiore Biorepository for receiving, handling, and storing plasma samples; the New York Blood Center for supplying CCP for the trial and Donna Strauss, MS, of the New York Blood Center for managing CCP distribution and shipments from the New York Blood Center to trial sites; and Mary Homer, PhD, of the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority for providing CCP for the trial via the New York Blood Center.\n The following exploratory analyses were proposed in the protocol: (1) CCP and participant plasma SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein binding antibody titer and neutralizing titer, (2) CCP and participant SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles and functional assays, (3) rates, levels and duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, (4) SARS-CoV-2 variants, (5) clinical status at other visit days, mortality and rates of discharge, (6) lymphocytes, neutrophils, and cytokines, and (7) moderating effect of concomitant medications\u2014including corticosteroids, remdesivir, and anticoagulants on CCP effects. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on our results is unknown, but 60% of Q5 enrollments were at NYC sites when the alpha and iota variants predominated,37 and surveillance data identified alpha and beta variants in Miami and alpha in Houston.38\nAlthough exploratory subgroup analyses suggested CCP may be beneficial in participants aged 65 years or older and those with less severe disease (WHO 5), the posterior probabilities of these findings exhibited considerable uncertainty."

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic COVID-19 both refer to people who don\u2019t have any signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Asymptomatic means that you\u2019ve tested positive for COVID-19, but have not developed symptoms, even after the incubation period for the coronavirus has passed.

An August 2023 study appeared to confirm the status of white-tailed deer as a disease reservoir, noting that the viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in deer occurs at triple the rate of its evolution in humans and that infection rates remained high, even in areas rarely frequented by humans.[590]\nDiscrimination and prejudice\nHeightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent were documented around the world.[592][593] Reports from February 2020, when most confirmed cases were confined to China, cited racist sentiments about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus.[594][595][596] Individuals of Asian descent in Europe and North America reported increasing instances of racially-motivated abuse and assaults as a result of the pandemic.[597][598][599] US President Donald Trump was criticised for referring to SARS-CoV-2 as the \"Chinese Virus\" and \"Kung Flu\", terms which were condemned as being racist and xenophobic.[600][601][602]\nAge-based discrimination against older adults increased during the pandemic. Some corporations made efforts to force workers to return to work on-site, while some embraced the idea.[670]\nTravel\nThere was a \"travel boom\" causing air travel to recover at rates faster than anticipated, and the aviation industry became profitable in 2023 for the first time since 2019, before the pandemic.[671] However, economic issues meant some predicted that the boom would begin to slow down.[672] Business travel on airlines was still below pre-pandemic levels and is predicted not to recover.[673]\nHealth\nAn increase in excess deaths from underlying causes not related to COVID-19 has been largely blamed on systematic issues causing delays in health care and screening during the pandemic, which has resulted in an increase of non-COVID-19 related deaths.[674]\nImmunizations\nDuring the pandemic, millions of children missed out on vaccinations as countries focused efforts on combating COVID-19. it was not clear whether young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested.[49] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.[50]\nAmong more thorough studies, preliminary results from 9 April 2020, found that in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 percent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies.[51] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, found rates of positive antibody tests that indicated more infections than reported.[52][53] Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[54]\nInitial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January 2020 were between 1.4 and 2.5,[55] but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[56]\n The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[113][114] The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[115]\nPrevention\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home or spending more time outdoors, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, wearing a mask in public, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[116][117]\nThose diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by healthcare authorities to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[118][119][120]\n"

            "content": "The risk is highest among household members, in whom transmission rates range between 10% and 40%.2-4 Close but less sustained contact such as sharing a meal is associated with a secondary attack rate of about 7%, whereas passing interactions among people shopping is associated with a secondary attack rate of 0.6%.4\nThe secondary attack rate among health care workers who unknowingly care for a patient with COVID-19 while wearing face masks alone or not using any personal protective equipment is also low; transmission studies suggest less than 3% (and the few health care worker infections that were documented in these transmission studies were associated with aerosol-generating procedures or prolonged exposures with inconsistent use of face masks).5,6 People infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be producing both droplets and aerosols on a constant basis but most of these emissions are not infecting other people. Investigators have demonstrated that speaking and coughing produce a mixture of both droplets and aerosols in a range of sizes, that these secretions can travel together for up to 27 feet, that it is feasible for SARS-CoV-2 to remain suspended in the air and viable for hours, that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be recovered from air samples in hospitals, and that poor ventilation prolongs the amount of time that aerosols remain airborne.1\nMany of these same characteristics have previously been demonstrated for influenza and other common respiratory viruses. If, however, SARS-CoV-2 is carried by aerosols that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods, medical masks would be inadequate (because aerosols can both penetrate and circumnavigate masks), face shields would provide only partial protection (because there are open gaps between the shield and the wearer\u2019s face), and 6 feet of separation would not provide protection from aerosols that remain suspended in the air or are carried by currents.\n To extrapolate about the effectiveness of respiratory protection for SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses, it would make more sense to extrapolate from the 4 randomized trials that have directly compared N95 respirators vs medical masks and found no difference between them in the rates of confirmed non\u2013SARS coronavirus infections and influenza infections among health care workers.9\nAll told, current understanding about SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still limited. What this means in practice is that keeping 6-feet apart from other people and wearing medical masks, high-quality cloth masks, or face shields when it is not possible to be 6-feet apart (for both source control and respiratory protection) should be adequate to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (in addition to frequent hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and optimizing indoor ventilation).\n"

            "content": "In the early stages of the pandemic, estimates indicated that children were less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the first place.1 And one of the first major retrospective studies about children and covid-19, by Chinese scientists in the first year of the pandemic, found that up to 90% of paediatric cases were asymptomatic, mild, or moderate.2\n\u201cChildren are more likely than adults to have asymptomatic or mild infections,\u201d says Anna Sick-Samuels, assistant professor of paediatrics at Johns Hopkins Medical School. One study found that adults who live in households with young children are less likely to have severe covid-19, potentially owing to acquired immunity from regular coronavirus infections.6\nMost children are also much less likely to have autoantibodies in their blood, which target the body\u2019s own cells and actively disable interferons, hindering the body\u2019s capability to fend off viruses.7 Autoantibodies tend to increase in the body with age, as mutations accumulate over the course of our lifetimes, with much high levels found in people aged 50 onwards. Before vaccines became widely available, estimates indicated that it affected approximately 316 in every 1\u2009000\u2009000 children infected with SARS-CoV-2.12 MIS-C was a concern for paediatricians in 2020, although researchers say that hospital admissions for this complication have become much rarer over the past two years,13 with vaccines seeming to reduce the risk, along with increasing population immunity from existing infections.14\nWe are just starting to understand what causes MIS-C. Because the symptoms typically begin four to six weeks after the initial infection, immunologists think that it might represent the most severe form of long covid. One of these antigens might even act as a superantigen, triggering a major inflammatory response\u2014a hypothesis that is now being explored further.15\n\u201cThe most well supported theory in my opinion is that a superantigen from SARS-CoV-2, and other microbes as a second hit following covid-19, could trigger unspecific activation of T-cells similar to what is seen in toxic shock syndrome,\u201d says Petter Brodin, professor of paediatric immunology at Imperial College London. Locally, we are starting to see wastewater levels of virus rise, and children likely are contributing to this increase in community levels.\u201d\nOther paediatricians, however, point out that the risk-benefit trade-off of vaccinating younger children to prevent covid-19 spreading in the wider population is not straightforward."

Five studies reported clusters of cases among individuals who had prolonged exposure to an infected individual within a confined space,38 45-48 and a single modelling study also suggests this may be important for transmission.49 Spouses and close household contacts also appeared to be at increased risk, compared to community contacts,50 51 though interestingly air sampling studies in the houses of people with COVID-19 were negative.52 Although some studies suggested possible transmissions at distances in excess of 2 metres,47 53 there wasn\u2019t sufficient description to rule out transmission via close or direct contact in any of the studies."

Considering the diverse immune and clinical landscape of long COVID and the difficulties that this poses in predicting and diagnosing the condition, research efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers to assist patient management.71 In order to predict the development of persistent symptoms in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers have tried to model biomarkers of cellular and/or molecular immune alterations during the acute phase, but results have been inconsistent among"

The passive transfer of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from the plasma of recently recovered individuals (COVID-19 convalescent plasma) to patients with severe COVID-19 was among the first therapies used.5-7 There is now substantial evidence suggesting that such antibody-based therapy, when administered early in the disease course (ie, within 72 hours since the onset of symptoms) and with high titers of neutralizing antibodies, is associated with a clinical benefit\u2014 including decreases in incidences of disease progression, hospitalization, and mortality.8,9\n The summary of findings tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE approach, which defines the certainty of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 Tool for randomized clinical trials23 and the Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for matched cohort studies.24 For both risk of bias assessment tools, each domain can score low risk if there is no indication for risk of bias, some concerns if there is potential for risk of bias, or high risk if there is clear indication for risk of bias."

We thank Jeff LaFleur, MA, and his team at the Einstein/Montefiore Biorepository for receiving, handling, and storing plasma samples; the New York Blood Center for supplying CCP for the trial and Donna Strauss, MS, of the New York Blood Center for managing CCP distribution and shipments from the New York Blood Center to trial sites; and Mary Homer, PhD, of the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority for providing CCP for the trial via the New York Blood Center.\n The following exploratory analyses were proposed in the protocol: (1) CCP and participant plasma SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein binding antibody titer and neutralizing titer, (2) CCP and participant SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles and functional assays, (3) rates, levels and duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs, (4) SARS-CoV-2 variants, (5) clinical status at other visit days, mortality and rates of discharge, (6) lymphocytes, neutrophils, and cytokines, and (7) moderating effect of concomitant medications\u2014including corticosteroids, remdesivir, and anticoagulants on CCP effects. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on our results is unknown, but 60% of Q5 enrollments were at NYC sites when the alpha and iota variants predominated,37 and surveillance data identified alpha and beta variants in Miami and alpha in Houston.38\nAlthough exploratory subgroup analyses suggested CCP may be beneficial in participants aged 65 years or older and those with less severe disease (WHO 5), the posterior probabilities of these findings exhibited considerable uncertainty."
